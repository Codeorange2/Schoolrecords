  <h1>Consumer Math Overview</h1>

  <p>In consumer math what I have been taught so far, ranges from opening a checking account, to college tuition, and various loans.
    I have been taught about taxes and how each person could have to fill out a different form depending on their circumstances, like employment, and income.
    It also went over figuring out your hourly wages and gross pay, also how to read a bank statement and keeping records. 
    It has also taught me about how to read a check stub or pay stub I don't remember exactly what it's called, but I do remember it showed what you paid on taxes and where it went like social security.
    This math has also taught me about the dangers of credit cards and debt, also to look at the APR (average percentage rate) showing that loans with the longest time period and the lowest amount of money per month.
    It also put into perspective how much debt you can accumulate from college if you don't play your cards right. I have a lot more to learn over the next 120 lessons.
